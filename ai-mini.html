    <h2>Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humans</h2>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is truly a revolutionary feat of computer science, set to become a core component of all modern software over the coming years and decades. This presents a threat but also an opportunity. AI will be deployed to augment both defensive and offensive cyber operations. Additionally, new means of cyber attack will be invented to take advantage of the particular weaknesses of AI technology. Finally, the importance of data will be amplified by AI’s appetite for large amounts of training data, redefining how we must think about data protection. Prudent governance at the global level will be essential to ensure that this era-defining technology will bring about broadly shared safety and prosperity.</p>

    <h2>AI and Big Data</h2>
    <div class="img-section">
      <img src="../ai-analytics-insights.jpg" alt="">
    </div>
    <p class="ai-paragrah">In general terms, AI refers to computational tools that are able to substitute for human intelligence in the performance of certain tasks. This technology is currently advancing at a breakneck pace, much like the exponential growth experienced by database technology in the late twentieth century. Databases have grown to become the core infrastructure that drives enterprise-level software. Similarly, most of the new value added from software over the coming decades is expected to be driven, at least in part, by AI.

      Within the last decade, databases have evolved significantly in order to handle the new phenomenon dubbed “big data.” This refers to the unprecedented size and global scale of modern data sets, largely gathered from the computer systems that have come to mediate nearly every aspect of daily life. For instance, YouTube receives over 400 hours of video content each minute (Brouwer 2015)</p>
    <br>
    <h2>AI and Cyber Security</h2>
    <div class="img-section" ><img src="../cybber-security.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <p class="ai-paragrah">Hardly a day passes without a news story about a high-profile data breach or a cyber attack costing millions of dollars in damages. Cyber losses are difficult to estimate, but the International Monetary Fund places them in the range of US$100–$250 billion annually for the global financial sector (Lagarde 2012). Furthermore, with the ever-growing pervasiveness of computers, mobile devices, servers and smart devices, the aggregate threat exposure grows each day. While the business and policy communities are still struggling to wrap their heads around the cyber realm’s newfound importance, the application of AI to cyber security is heralding even greater changes.</p>
    <p class="ai-paragrah">
      One of the essential purposes of AI is to automate tasks that previously would have required human intelligence. Cutting down on the labour resources an organization must employ to complete a project, or the time an individual must devote to routine tasks, enables tremendous gains in efficiency. For instance, chatbots can be used to field customer service questions, and medical assistant AI can be used to diagnose diseases based on patients’ symptoms.
    </p>
    <p class="ai-paragrah">
      In a simplified model of how AI could be applied to cyber defence, log lines of recorded activity from servers and network components can be labelled as “hostile” or “non-hostile,” and an AI system can be trained using this data set to classify future observations into one of those two classes. The system can then act as an automated sentinel, singling out unusual observations from the vast background noise of normal activity.

            Asked about the ethics of AI with respect to scientific and medical research, Jon Herington, PhD, Assistant Professor of Philosophy, and Health Humanities and Bioethics at the University of Rochester, focuses on the importance of “data ethics.”

“The foundation of accurate and fair machine learning (ML) algorithms is representative and responsible datasets,” Dr. Herington told PRIM&R. “If we want ML to contribute to a healthier and more equitable future, then it’s our duty as scientists to make sure we collect data in ways that are responsive to the diverse capacities, goals, and histories of the people within our communities.”
